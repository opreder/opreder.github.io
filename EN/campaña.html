                    <h3>WHAT WORDS CAUSE </h3>
                    <p>He led a young woman full of energy to keep sitting in a corner, being consumed by despair. Everything was going in a natural direction, a little girl was part of a family, where one day she observed her tired mother, she offers her help in the kitchen, without having any knowledge of this, drops something; her mother, in case of understanding her, decided to recite a few words to her, which were not suitable for this situation.
                        Over the years, he could see his father desperate for a conflict, approaching him to help him solve his problems, but with a not very good attitude, he reluctantly turns to her, telling her that he has no knowledge about what is going on. Childhood, has become a memory that in the end and after the passage of time this sad girl, will be anything but sane. Her adolescence arrived, but each time, her world worsened; in her day to day she was hurt by echoes of the past that rumble in her head; she, is ready to do everything pending, taking into account that at the time, she wanted something to eat, her soda spills, her body shudders and her blood boils, she loses control, she is filled with rage and begins to beat herself on the head while phrases said in the past recite in her; passing the days, in the face of overwhelming situations that do not let her feel good, "What can I do if I can’t do anything?"
                        In despair, he leans against the wall and falls down it, clutching his hair with his hands filled with anger.
                        What would have happened if everything was different? Something better would have happened, for sure.</p>

                    <h3> PRISONER OF MY WORDS </h3>
                    <p>What would the world be like if we all kept quiet forcibly just because the other person doesn’t want to listen?
                        Not everyone in society may be experiencing it but a fundamental part suffers this constantly, the so-called 
                         future of society are dragged into silence because they are not always taken into account when giving opinions and for this there are thousands of pretexts "You are too young" <br>
                          "You know nothing of life" among others but keep in mind that we will not always be young and one day if we do not change this mentality we will be the elders who end the dreams of our successors, 
                         we know nothing of life... And that’s why we have to say and ask and the fact that we keep quiet the only thing it does is that we lose the motivation, that it serves to say if we will never be heard... <br>
                         maybe if I talk to the wall at some point it takes 
                         and crush anyone who dares to harm the hope of youth.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3> WHAT THE EYES DON’T SEE </h3>
                    <p>In most cases, people go through periods of their lives that mark them forever, these can be positive situations or not. Usually these periods that remain in us happen in adolescence, 
                        time when we are more sensitive and where we have more changes... It is where we experience who we are, our tastes, where we want to go and the people we want to <br>
                        accompany us on our journey. In turn,
                         is at this age,  <br>
                         where parents and children do not have a <br>
                          good communication and differences of thoughts make many words or actions that stay with us and make us change who we are... So keep 
                         care and measure every gesture or word that you can direct towards another person, we do not know the impact that it may have on her or the blameless mark that you can leave her for her life.</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <a href="#"><img src="../imgs/campañas/4.jpg" alt=""></a>
                    <h3>SILENT BY OTHERS HANDS</h3>
                    <p>Nothing and no one should allow to silence the ideas, expressions or words of others, and this is why many young people today go through , they deprive themselves of saying grandiose ideas for 
                        who will say, but this fear is born from home, from parents, they are responsible for generating this in their children, whether consciously or unconsciously, as children and adolescents say <br>
                        are the future, but in itself, each adult/parent is the present <br>
                        of each of these and who prepares them for a "suitable" future, each adult is responsible for future behaviors, teachings and treatment that a child or adolescent has in society, they should pay more attention to their actions and questions, 
                        do not close ideas to new changes and possibilities. Much less think that it is bold or rude to say what they think. Because this will bring serious consequences of which the parents themselves are the ones who complain.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <a href="#"><img src="../imgs/campañas/5.jpg" alt=""></a>
                    <h3>ACHIEVING FREEDOM</h3>
                    <p>Finally comes a day where everything begins to consume us, where we try to move forward and look forward ignoring all those words, all those situations that over the years we saw as insignificant, ignoring the fact that we feel insufficient for society because we are young, because we do not have as broad a knowledge as our parents may have just because we are "older" or because we "have more experience in life".
                     <Br>
                        And that day the foolish words ever heard, try to drag us to prevent us from leaving this void in which we fell, perhaps without realizing it, perhaps being aware of it, in any case, without the necessary willpower, without the support of those who are supposed to be our example, with the stigma of being the "crystal generation", with the looks they judge, It is easy to submerge and let yourself fall into a darkness that was growing with the passing of time and that perhaps the only solution would be to look up and keep fighting for yourself without letting go of that inner light that kept us alive day after day.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <a href="#"><img src="../imgs/campañas/6.jpg" alt=""></a>
                    <h3>CHAOS AND TRANQUILITY  </h3>
                    <p>Not always what we show on the outside is what really happens inside us.
                        If you ask anyone around you about her I would tell you that she is a very happy person, who is always positive and happy with that permanent smile on her face, no one 
                        I could tell you negative things about her attitude but what really happens is that she inwardly feels married, she is fed up to the point of fading into the tears of sadness she keeps every day; you’ll wonder why, 
                        the answer is simpler than you think and you may even find it seen not only in the environment of it but also can pass by you and it is that she always hears words from her parents that assure is to reinforce or correct, "it is your obligation" "You’re a nuisance, change at once"
                    "You really like this, it’s awful" those simple words as they say, 
                        They really destroy this girl in the worst way, causing her fear and insecurity. Although it does not prove it she keeps in her external tranquility an internal chaos</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <a href="#"><img src="../imgs/campañas/7.jpg" alt=""></a>
                    <h3>MATERNAL UNDERSTANDING</h3>
                    <p>There is no being that can love another person more than a mother his son and a son his mother.
                        The relationship between these two beings is fundamental to anyone’s life, there will be no person who 
                        be more willing to give all that one of these two people for the other and to be such a great bond 
                        <br >important, in turn can be diverted and hurt each other. <br>
                        For this reason, we must be aware of the trust that people give us, especially adults towards young people, in particular mothers to their children... <br>
                        Being young is not synonymous with inferiority or matters 
                        that have no relevance, be sensitive to what young people have to tell us and do not believe that adults are superior only
                        for giving them a small advantage in life. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                    <a href="#"><img src="../imgs/campañas/8.jpg" alt=""></a>
                    <h3> RELEASE LOOK </h3>
                    <p>Today despite the constant talks by society about suicide and depression, we do not understand and pay the necessary attention to this problem and its background; we only see the outside saying that a person with a permanent smile on his face is not someone who holds pain and contains tears and even if we see carefully people who show signs of sadness we only share brief and empty talks that are always governed by a protocol, when we must not only ask but act, help and as is commonly said put ourselves in the shoes of the other.
                        Many young people today drown trying to contain and endure the pressure that is put on them by adults, sadly society does not pay the best attention to young people who always call under the heading "the future of the country" leaving them adrift from the injunctions and even blows by their parents who throw with the excuse "it is for a better upbringing and teaching"; we must lend it better <br> 
                        attention and not just stop their actions and throw meaningless words, stop saying they don’t appreciate life or it’s just a cowardly decision. </p>
